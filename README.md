# dmhelpz

The idea behind this project was to create a tool to help DMs manage encounters
and general gameplay. I also wanted to try out the GraphQL functionality of the
DnD API and this was a great opportunity.

_very much a work in progress_

## GraphQL

This project uses the `gqlgenc` package to generate a GraphQL client for the DnD API.
